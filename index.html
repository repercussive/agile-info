    <h1>Agile Principles</h1>

    <p>
      Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and
      continuous delivery of valuable software.
      <br /><br />

      Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes
      harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
      <br /><br />

      Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of
      months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
      <br /><br />

      Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the
      project.
      <br /><br />

      Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and
      support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
      <br /><br />

      The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and
      within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
      <br /><br />

      Working software is the primary measure of progress.
      <br /><br />

      Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers,
      and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
      <br /><br />

      Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances
      agility.
      <br /><br />

      Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is
      essential.
      <br /><br />

      The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from
      self-organizing teams.
      <br /><br />

      At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective,
      then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
